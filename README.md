# Turing

`Turing` is a simple solver for mathematical puzzles. The program is
able to solve simple instances of the following games:

* [Garam](https://www.garam.fr/garam/garam_en_ligne/tutoriel/): fill a
  grid so that each operation is correct.

* [Futoshiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki): fill a 6x6
  grid with digits so that each column and each row contains all of
  the digits from 1 to 6, and all order relationships given in the
  grid are enforced.

* [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku): fill a 9x9 grid with
  digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3
  blocks that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
